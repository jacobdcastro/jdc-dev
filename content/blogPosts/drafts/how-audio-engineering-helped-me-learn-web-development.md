I grew up with a handful of different hobbies and interests.

When I was younger, I played sports which lead me to choose basketball as my main sport. Got pretty good to be honest, with respect to my age range.

I also got into skateboarding and longboarding. Trying to learn how to ollie, shove-it, and heelflip were some of my first challenges. But I also tried to go into longboard sliding and downhill racing. But living in a literal flat town, that didn't go anywhere.

In high school, I took a graphic design class. Photoshop and Illustrator skills still serve a purpose for me today.

Economics in high school exposed me to the world of the stock market. I actually loved it and started following the stock market with those virtual market app games and played with fake money to follow profit and losses.

I've also always loved science and eventually dove deep into astronomy and theoretical astrophysics.

This was all for fun... I had a very wide range of interests.

One of my favorite hobbies was (and still is) music. This lead me to become the 'sound guy' at the local church I attended.

## Deep Dive Into The Audio World

To this day, I still enjoy playing around with friends recording some song covers, or even original song ideas. I still occasionally run the soundboard at my current local church. But it wasn't always so easy.

I am 90% self-taught in my audio skills. I started 7 years ago when I was 15 years old. And when I say it was a deep dive, it was a serious **deep dive**.

I had someone more experienced show me around during my first few weeks. Then he had a kid soon after and took a break from being involved with sound, rightfully so. The other sound guy was moving away at the same time.

So there left me. A 15 year old kid, about a month into doing sound; I'm the only person in the whole church who was available to run sound now.

I had no idea what I was doing.

So I ended up doing a bunch of self-learning through Youtube videos, playing around with DAW software ([Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/) 7 at the time), and spent tons of extra hours at my church to really dial in details with sound and learn their system.

Then, about a year later, they announced they would be moving from a dedicated building where the sound system was set up 24/7, to a high school auditorium. This meant we would have to unload a trailer with **all** of our audio equipment, set it up early in the morning, use it for one church service, dismantle the entire system, store it away in said trailer, and repeat. Every single week.

I was terrified, as I was the only dedicated sound guy at the church.

Then, one day, came the magic question:

"Can you design the new sound system for us?"

_Well, here we go..._

## My Most Valuable Lesson

One day, I was learning what a certain knob or switch does, and how to take out a little bit of feedback from a problematic microphone.

The next day, I needed to learn what an entire sound system even needs for it work, how to dismantle and rebuild it, dealing with proper acoustics configuration for a new building with zero sound dampening (it was a very echo-y auditorium), and what type of equipment is best suited to take such an "on-the-road" beating.

This practically became my first job. People make livings with what I learned to do, and I was pretty much paid in coffee. Still grateful for that though, not gonna lie... I needed it for the 5:30am Sunday mornings.

Earlier, I mentioned I am 90% self-taught with my audio skills. I did have an occasional mentor to help me out and teach me some things if/when he was in town. He spent most of his time on tour doing this stuff for a living. Shoutout to Ryan for the help.

When it came to learning everything else when Ryan wasn't in town, I opted for self-guided learning. It was literally my only option.

Aside from learning all the technical aspects of designing, building, and maintianing a sound system, I learned a super valuable lesson.

**I learned how to learn.**

I've learned almost all of my hobbies on my own through the internet. But this was the first time my self-guided studies needed to be directly and immediately applied with larger-than-myself consequences.

I felt so much pressure, there was a lot on my shoulders. Scared as hell and excited, nonetheless, I kept learning and learning and learning.

Two years later, right out of high school, I decided to try a new hobby: web development.

Cue the self-guided learning once again.

## Translating Audio Engineering to JavaScript

I had an interest in STEM subjects. And I thought coding sounded pretty cool. So, I enrolled in my local community college with a major in Computer Science, then took my first C++ course.

It was actually super fun and taught me a lot about programming concepts. But after seeing the future curriculum for the CS degree, it was leading me toward a path I wasn't interested in. I wanted to learn programming for the web, not... data and analytics.

Naturally, I jumped on Google and searched things like "how to learn web development" and "html and css tutorials". It was really no different than having to learn audio engineering, minus the percieved church-wide pressure.

I came across an online tech learning platform, [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), and began learning frontend web development on the evenings, and in between classes. I would do so in the student computer center, since I didn't have my own laptop, hoping 1 of the 4 Macs were available. One usually was and I had so much fun learning frontend development!

Then while learning, something really cool began to happen.

My mental model for web development concepts directly reflected my understanding of audio engineering.

I found myself restating ideas in web development using audio language, such as "signal", "preprocessing" and "postprocessing", "filters", "line in/out", "feedback", and tons more. And it all made more sense to me whenever I did so.

The lightbulb moment finally struck:

The web is just a digital sound system.

I began to intentionally visualize everything in terms of audio engineering. And I'm pretty sure it helped me learn that much faster.

## How Does This Work?

Let's take a look at how a sound system works at a basic level.

**Problem**: A guitarist is playing an electric guitar on the stage. But people need to hear it from the back of the room, too; the guitar is way too quiet. It needs to be amplified with the stage speakers, and sound good doing so.

Alright, let's take this step by step.

### Stage 1. Initial guitar signal

The guitar is the source of sound. It's what is creating the intial electrical signal containing the guitar audio. This initial signal is known as the "dry" signal, since it hasn't been processed yet.

The cable from an electric guitar is usually plugged into a pedal or two or 15 to process the sound of the guitar to make it sound good. This adds distortion, reverb, delay, and all kinds of other cool effects. You do this by chaining more cables from one pedal to the next, so the electric guitar signal can pass through each pedal individually, getting processed and adjusted along the way.

Once passing through each pedal, it goes to a guitar amplifier (amp), which usually does a little more processing before actually spitting out our first guitar sound! But amps are generally located backstage where the audience can't hear it. So we aren't done yet.

Let's recap the signal chain so far: guitar => pedal => pedal => pedal => amp.

### Stage 2. Moving the guitar's audio to the soundboard.

The sound now coming from the guitar amp is good, but nowhere near loud enough. We need that sound to come out of the house speakers. The solution? A microphone!

A small microphone stand with a mic is now 2 inches away from the amp speaker listening to the sound. But where does the microphone send the newly captured audio? It sends the signal through the cable that it's connected to! That cable then leads straight backstage where a device called a 'snake' is located.

The snake has inputs for lots of cables, sometimes up to 64, where it can recieve many signals. For convience's sake, the snake combines all signals it recieves into one fat cable that leads straight back to the audio booth. The one snake cable then splits back up into many cable ends that can be plugged individually into the sound board. Each cable has a number assigned to it, and the number of each cable corresponds to a specific plug in the back of the soundboard that is also numbered. Once plugged into the proper plug in the sound board, the technological magic can begin!

Recap time: guitar => pedal => pedal => pedal => amp => microphone => snake => soundboard.

### Stage 3. Preparing the audio to be heard across the room.

=======================

I absolutely love React. Despite having a tough time with it at first (as it was my first framework), I really got the hang of it with the help of my new visualization system.
